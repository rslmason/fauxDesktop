# Faux Desktop

## Description 
This web app mimics the appearance and functionality of an old Windows desktop. It's hosted [here](https://faux-desktop.netlify.app/). The app was written using HTML, CSS/SASS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Repository History and Rationale
I created this prototype with the intention of using the finished project as my personal portfolio site at the end of a web dev bootcamp. I was told that it was too unusual and that I should use something more 'normal', so I left out some features I had planned. I'm leaving it here for posterity and because I love it. 

## Features
The faux desktop has 'programs' with interactive windows, a start menu, and icons you can move around.
